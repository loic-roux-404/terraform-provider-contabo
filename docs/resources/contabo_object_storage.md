  Manage S3 compatible Object Storage. With the Object Storage API you can create Object Storages in different locations. Please note that you can only have one Object Storage per location. Furthermore, you can increase the amount of storage space and control the autoscaling feature which allows you to automatically perform a monthly upgrade of the disk space to the specified maximum. You might also inspect the usage. This API is not the S3 API itself. For accessing the S3 API directly or with S3 compatible tools like aws cli and after having created / upgraded your Object Storage please use the S3 URL from this Storage API and refer to the User Mangement API to retrieve the S3 credentials.

# contabo_object_storage (Resource)

Manage S3 compatible Object Storage. With the Object Storage API you can create Object Storages in different locations. Please note that you can only have one Object Storage per location. Furthermore, you can increase the amount of storage space and control the autoscaling feature which allows you to automatically perform a monthly upgrade of the disk space to the specified maximum. You might also inspect the usage. This API is not the S3 API itself. For accessing the S3 API directly or with S3 compatible tools like `aws` cli and after having created / upgraded your Object Storage please use the S3 URL from this Storage API and refer to the User Mangement API to retrieve the S3 credentials.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure your Contabo API credentials
provider "contabo" {
  oauth2_client_id     = "[your client id]"
  oauth2_client_secret = "[your client secret]"
  oauth2_user          = "[your username]"
  oauth2_pass          = "[your password]"
}

# Create a new object storage in region EU
resource "contabo_object_storage" "object_storage_eu" {
  region                   = "EU"
	total_purchased_space_tb = 2
}

# Update a new object storage, enable autoscaling
resource "contabo_object_storage" "object_storage_eu" {
  auto_scaling {
    state         = "enabled"
    size_limit_tb = 5
  }
}
```
